This project aims to develop an AI-powered system that predicts the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in individuals based on their responses to the AQ-10 questionnaire, along with demographic and medical information such as age, family history, and jaundice. The system uses machine learning algorithms, with XGBoost providing the highest accuracy, to make binary predictions (autistic or not autistic). A web interface built using FastAPI collects user inputs and displays predictions in real-time. To enhance trust and interpretability, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is integrated, allowing users to understand how each input feature influences the modelâ€™s decision.
